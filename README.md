# AntiCheat

Anticheat is a clientside JS script that enables you to track changes in screen dimensions, keystrokes, tab switches. This code could possibly be used in online test taking portals to prevent cheating. This uses JQuery as a dependency, however it can totally be removed if not needed. 

NOTE : Copy Paste detectection from selection menu is yet to be added.
